Use ./driver.sh n to enumerate Williamson sequences of order n divisible by 2, 3, or 5
or ./driver.sh n m to enumerate Williamson sequences of orders between n and m (for either even orders or orders 3 mod 6)

The scripts assume that the version of the programmatic SAT solver MapleSAT
which has been tailored to search for Williamson sequences has been compiled
and is located in this directory under the name 'maplesat_static'; the
script ./compile_maplesat.sh will attempt to download and compile this
custom SAT solver.
