Use ./driver.sh n to enumerate complex Golay pairs of order n>1
or ./driver.sh n m to enumerate complex Golay pairs of orders between n and m

The scripts assume that the version of the programmatic SAT solver MapleSAT
which has been tailored to search for complex Golay pairs has been compiled
and is located in this directory under the name 'maplesat_static'; the
script ./compile_maplesat.sh will attempt to download and compile this
custom SAT solver.
