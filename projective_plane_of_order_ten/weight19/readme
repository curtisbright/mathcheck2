This directory contains scripts for searching for a primitive word of weight 19
in the code generated by a projective plane of order ten.  The scripts in 'a1'
find the A1 possibilities, the scripts in 'a2' find the A2 possibilities, and
the scripts in 'main' complete the search showing that all A1s and A2s cannot
be completed into a full incidence matrix.

See the paper 'A SAT-based Resolution of Lam's Problem' for more details.
