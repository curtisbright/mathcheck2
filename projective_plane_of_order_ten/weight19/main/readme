Use './driver.sh n m' to generate and solve instances that attempt to show that
the mth A2 associated with Lam's case n does not extend to a complete incidence
matrix.  Alternatively, provide 'all' as the second argument to solve all A2s
associated with case n.  Certificates will be generated and verified which show
that each case has no (or possibly a small number) of partial incidence matrix
completions.

Once all the instances have been solved, use 'final-step/solve.sh all' to
generate instances which show that each partial solution found cannot be
extended to a complete six blocks (plus one outside block).

The ./compile.sh script will compile a programmatic SAT solver which generates
a conflict clause for each solution of the SAT instances and thereby performs
an exhaustive search.
