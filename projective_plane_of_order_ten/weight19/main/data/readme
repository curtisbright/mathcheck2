This directory contains data files associated with each case.

The 'order' files contain the default ordering of the six inside blocks.  Each
line in the file corresponds with one block.  The line contains the block index
followed by four indices: the first two indices represent the first and last
column indices of the block (with the exception of columns that intersect other
blocks) and the last two indices represent the first and last column indices of
any undetermined columns that intersect other blocks.

The 'cutoff' files contain experimentally-chosen cube-and-conquer cutoff bounds
to use in the SAT instances.  There are up to four separate bounds
corresponding with how many inside blocks (between 3 and 6) were selected to
appear in the SAT instance (before dropping any blocks, if applicable).
