Use ./driver.sh to run a SAT+CAS solver to find all 396 nonisomorphic
1-factorizations of the complete graph on ten vertices.

The script requires the programmatic SAT solver MapleSAT which has been
tailored to search for 1-factorizations to be located in this directory under
the name 'maplesat_exhaustive'.  The driver script will call the script
compile_maplesat.sh to download and compile this custom SAT solver.
