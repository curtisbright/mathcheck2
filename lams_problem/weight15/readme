Use ./driver.sh to run a SAT+CAS solver and use an incremental SAT instance to
prove the nonexistence of codewords of weight 15 in a projective plane of order
ten.

Alternatively, ./driver_with_blocking_clauses.sh does this using a SAT instance
with blocking clauses (generated using SAT+CAS) to perform symmetry breaking.

Alternatively, ./driver_no_symmetry_breaking.sh does this using a pure SAT
approach.

The first two scripts assume that the version of the programmatic SAT solver
MapleSAT which has been tailored to search for codewords of weight 15 has been
compiled and is located in this directory under the name 'maplesat_exhaustive'.
The driver scripts will call the script compile_maplesat.sh to download and
compile this custom SAT solver.
